# LSC Lighting maXim fixture creator
A simple tool that makes it easier to create fixtures for your LSC Lighting maXim console. Even though this tool should make it easier for you to create fixtures, it isn't fully beginner friendly. Please refer to the [fixture creation manual](http://www.lsclighting.com/help-centre/downloads/func-startdown/411/) to find out how it truly works. 

## Todo
- As page 22 of the fixture creation manual tells, it's possible to add a parameter stop to multiple attributes. You can currently select multiple attributes, but you can't add the different wheelstops.
- As an addition to the previous point, those wheelstops can have seperate mouseable/readable values aswell. (page 27)
- Automatically replacing 'lt' with @ (page 31) or atleast adding these special characters to the UI. 
- An intensity channel is required, but not all RGB lights have a master dimmer, some just have 3 channels (RGB).
