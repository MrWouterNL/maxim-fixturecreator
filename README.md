# LSC Lighting maXim fixture creator
A simple tool that makes it easier to create fixtures for your LSC Lighting maXim console. Even though this tool should make it easier for you to create fixtures, it isn't fully beginner friendly. Please refer to the [fixture creation manual](http://www.lsclighting.com/help-centre/downloads/func-startdown/411/) to find out how it truly works.
